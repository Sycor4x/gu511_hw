    "\n",
    "in some of the following exercises, we are going to be running a `jupyter notebook` server to edit a `jupyter notebook`. we need to create a `python` environment which is capable of doing just that.\n",

    "+ `matplotlib`\n",

    "+ `plotly`\n",
    "+ `scikit-learn`\n",
    "+ `seaborn`\n",
    "\n",
    "note: as I said above, you're going to be using this `conda` environment and the `jupyter` package you install into it to create a notebook server, and you're going to connect to that notebook server with your web browser to open and edit notebook files. you need to choose whether you want to run that `jupyter notebook` service *locally* or *remotely*\n",

    "    1. launch `jupyter notebook` with the `--ip` parameter set to `127.0.0.1`\n",
    "        + this causes your `jupyter` service to *listen* for requests from outside the `ec2` server as well as from within (the default behavior is within only)\n",
    "    2. open the port (default: 8888) to your ip or the world (via the `ec2` console)\n",
    "    3. access the service at http://your.ip.add.ress:8888/\n",
    "2. set up `ssh` tunnel port forwarding\n",
    "    1. this is a way of suggesting that requests on your *local* port 8888 be redirected over the ssh tunnel to your `ec2` server, where they are routed to the `ec2` port 8888.\n",
    "    2. from linux or mac, the command is: `ssh -N -f -L localhost:[PORT YOU WANT LOCALLY]:localhost:[PORT JUPYTER IS RUNNING ON REMOTELY] [USER@HOSTNAME or SSH_CONFIG_ALIAS]`\n",
