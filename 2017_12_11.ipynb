    "\n",
    "for about the last month I have been persisting the results of our beloved FFA `json` api (note: [it's moving!](https://services.faa.gov/)). let's pull records and calculate the proportion of time different airports report delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1: the schema\n",
    "\n",
    "the primary key for this `dynamodb` table has the following two pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. hash key: `IATA`, the three-digit US airport code\n",
    "2. range key: `Timestamp`, the time the `api` was called\n",
    "\n",
    "a single record in this database will look like:\n",

    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"city\": \"Washington\",\n",
    "  \"delay\": \"false\",\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2: querying counts\n",
    "\n",
    "for each of our different `dynamodb` lookup methods, it's helpful to remember that each query is executed slightly differently. if we break it down by speed, the ability to filter or range results before returning, and the number of records read by `dynamodb` while the query is executing, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "| type of lookup | speed     | filtering or ranging? | number of records seen by `dynamodb`    |\n",
    "|----------------|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `get_item`     | immediate | no                    | 1                                       |\n",
    "| `query`        | faster    | yes                   | the size of the primary key's partition |\n",
    "| `scan`         | slowest   | yes                   | the size of the database                |\n",
    "\n",
    "in addition to the above, it's also worth knowing that `dynamodb` implements one (and really only one) aggregation function -- `COUNT`. for `query` and `scan` lookups. the `COUNT` operator is a modifier of the `SELECT` method (that is, you can select all attributes, select certain attributes, or select the count of records). if you stipulate a `Select` method of `COUNT`, `dynamodb` will scan as many records as is needed (see the last field in the table above), apply any filters that are needed, and then return not the records but the count of the records that would be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "we can use that to our advantage here. if we `query` our table for a particular airport code and use the `COUNT` selection method, we can get\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the count of all records for that IATA, or\n",
    "2. the count of all records for that IATA satisfying a certain criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "one immediate and easy criterion: whether or not the `delay` string has a value of `\"true\"`. as a bonus, if we manage to construct a query which can select for us those filtered records, `dynamodb`'s response to us will include *both* the number of those filtered records *and* the number or records it had to scan to figure that out (which is all of them).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3: using `boto3` to build `dynamodb` key and filter expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "`boto3` has built-in functions for building `dynamodb` conditions, and they are generally preferred to the hard-coded versions with `#attrname` and `:attrvalue` strings and `ExpressionAttributeNames` and `ExpressionAttributeValues` mapping dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, if we had a table with movies which had `Year` as their primary (hash) key, and had a `Title` attribute, we could filter those records down to those movies which were made in 2001 and had titles which begin with a letter between `A` and `L`, both of the following would work:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# hard-coded string and name/value lookup dictionary method\n",
    "movietable.query(\n",
    "    KeyConditionExpression=\"year = :myyear\",\n",
    "    FilterExpression=\"title between :letter0 and :letter1\",\n",
    "    ExpressionAttributeValues={\n",
    "        ':myyear': 2001,\n",
    "        ':letter0': 'A',\n",
    "        ':letter1': 'L'\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# object-oriented method\n",
    "from boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Key, Attr\n",
    "\n",
    "movietable.query(\n",
    "    KeyConditionExpression=Key('year').eq(2001),\n",
    "    FilterExpression=Attr('title').between('A', 'L')\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "aside from being more compact, this second method requires less visual jumping around while debugging or reading. let's use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4: accessing the `dynamodb` database\n",
    "\n",
    "as we discussed in lecture, `dynamodb` is a 100%-`iam`-authenticated service. to access material in my `AirportWeather` `dynamodb` table, you need to inhabit an `iam` `role` or act as an `iam` `user`. I created a special `iam` `user` named `dynamodb_airportweather_readonly` for this specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "this `user` has access keys which can be used by the `boto3.session.Session` object. I have uploaded those values as a credentials `csv` to all of your individual `s3` buckets. you can acquire those `csv` files via the command\n",
