# Georgetown University Math & Statistics 511 **EXERCISES**

these notebooks are the exercises for the GU511 course. Each of them will be
named / identified by their corresponding due date:

```
YYYY_MM_DD.ipynb
```

what exactly is "due" will change from assignment to assignment, but will be
spelled out in detail in every assignment.

your first source for homework assignments should be the [Microsoft Azure
Notebooks
Server](https://notebooks.azure.com/rzachlamberty/libraries/gu511-hw). If you
are having problems with that site, the backup location (where notebooks are
rendered but not clonable nor executable) is the [github
repo](https://github.com/rzl-ds/gu511_hw).

if you have any questions, send them
to [rzl5@georgetown.edu](mailto:rzl5@georgetown.edu).
