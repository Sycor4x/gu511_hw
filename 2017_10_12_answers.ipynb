    "copy the `html` file you are using as your index page to a new file called `error.html`, and edit that new file to contain an error message. This might be as simple as replacing the header (the `<h1>` element) and first paragraph (the `<p>` element) so that they contain warnings that a \"page is missing\" or \"this url was an error\". If you have your own `error.html` file, feel free to use that instead.\n",

    "# exercise 3: turn a `python` script into a `cron` job on the `ec2` box\n",
    "\n",
    "the above `bash` command is something that could be put into a [`crontab`](http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference) entry on a linux machine, and run with some frequency by [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). let's do that!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### breaking it down\n",
    "\n",
    "as we said in lectures, `cron` is a linux command scheduling service. it is constantly running, and every minute it checks to see if there are commands which must be executed at that time. users can request that commands be executed with some fixed frequency (up to minute resolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "the way that users add elements to \"the schedule\" is by editing a file called a `crontab`. the name `crontab` is short of `cron` table, because the items are expected to be entered in a sort of tabular format (more on that below).\n",
    "\n",
    "users can use the linux command `crontab` to interact with these files -- try `man crontab` and `crontab -h` on your `ec2` server to see the available options, or jump right in \n",
    "\n",
    "a `cron` entry consists of an execution frequency statement and a command to execute\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### execution frequency statement\n",
    "\n",
    "an entry in a `crontab` file will start with a 5-element sequence that dictates how frequently a command should be executed. you can see several examples on the [`cron` wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), and check out [this cool webapp](https://crontab.guru/) to see what options are available and what a given statement means in \"human\" terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "as an example, we could choose to run a job every day at midnight using the frequency statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 0 * * *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "one thing to be aware of: our `ubuntu` computers are using `UTC` for time -- type the `date` command to see what time your `ec2` server thinks it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**develop a `crontab` frequency expression to execute our command: every day at 6:00 AM EST**\n",
    "\n",
    "don't worry about daylight savings time or any of that right now -- just make sure that the timestamp on the file the next time it runs (i.e. any day within the next month) is 6:00 AM EST.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### command statement\n",
    "\n",
    "`cron` is effectively just executing shell statements for you, so anything you can type in a `bash` shell is fair game -- including the `python alarm_clock.py` statement from the previous exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `cron` and your `PATH` variable\n",
    "\n",
    "there is an important difference between how you normally execute `bash` commands and how `cron` will do that: whenever you *manually* start up a shell session via `ssh`, your `bash` shell will `source` the contents of your `.bashrc` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cron` **will not do this**.\n",
    "\n",
    "this is important for a lot of reasons, but the most important right now is that `source`-ing your `.bashrc` will populate your `PATH` variable. We've discussed this several times in class, but it bears repeating: `conda` and `conda` environments depend critically on *changing* this `PATH` variable so that when you type `python` the shell session *resolves* that command to be the particular `python` executable you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "when you executed the `python alarm_clock.py` command in the previous exercise, `python` resolved to something depending on your `PATH`. after you've successfully run that command, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. execute `which python` to see which `python` executable you used\n",
    "2. execute `echo $PATH` to see what your `PATH` variable is \n",
    "\n",
    "depending on actions you took (e.g. `source activate myenv`), your `PATH` variable would change. on your `ec2` server,\n",
    "\n",
    "+ if no changes have been made to your `PATH` at all, `python` will resolve to nothing and `python3` will resolve to `/usr/bin/python3`\n",
