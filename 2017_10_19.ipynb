    "# exercise 2: setting up `kms` encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "in the `s3` lecture, I mentioned that `s3` supports *server-side* encryption as a simple check box (that is, whenever a file is received by `s3` it will encrypt it (jumble the contents so they are unreadable to a human) with a secret key, and it will decrypt that file (reverse that jumbling) whenver someone who is approved (e.g. *you*) requests that file. I also mentioned that *client-side* encryption -- where you as a user jumble the contents before you even send them to `s3`, and decrypt the jumbled contents when they're sent back to you -- is another option, but it requires extra effort, and I didn't elaborate on that extra effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "then, in the web scraping lectures, I mentioned that it might be possible to store an *encrypted* (jumbled) version of a password in plain text on your local machine and that if you new how to *decrypt* (un-jumble) that encrypted version that this would be more secure than saving the regular password in plain text. but I didn't discuss how you might do that at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "let's walk through how *client-side encryption* can be done relatively easily using the `aws kms` service and the `python boto3` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "the end result here will be a pair of `python` functions which can encrypt and upload a secret message, and then download and decrypt that same message.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ for the administrator, select your personal `iam` user.\n",
